	 * schema will be made a candidate for garbage collection. If the timeout wasn't
	 * reached yet and a second query requires the same schema, the timeout will be
	 * re-computed from the time of the second access and a new hard reference is
	 * established until the new timer reaches its end.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * If the timeout is equal to zero, the schema will get pinned permanently. It
	 * is inadvisable to use this mode when using a DynamicSchemaProcessor at the
	 * risk of filling up the memory.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * If the timeout is a negative value, the reference will behave the same as a
	 * {@link SoftReference}. This is the default behavior.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The timeout value must be provided as a String representing both the time
	 * value and the time unit. For example, 1 second is represented as "1s". Valid
	 * time units are [d, h, m, s, ms], representing respectively days, hours,
	 * minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * Defaults to "-1s".
